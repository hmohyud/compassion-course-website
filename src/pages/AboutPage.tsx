              <p className="team-role"><em>Editor and proofreader</em></p>
              <p>She came across Marshall B. Rosenberg's NVC for the first time when her son was two and was becoming more and more autonomous. Together with his autonomy, their family life was becoming more and more stormy. After she came across M. Rosenberg's idea, nothing was the same. Relationships which were important to her become more profound and colorful. After eight years this process is still in progress. For her Nonviolent Communication is feeling deep from the heart, being in connection with the source of life. From this connection, comes action, making conscious choices, enriching one's own life and the surrounding world.</p>
              <p>Agnes is very happy that she can contribute to the Polish edition of the course with her editing and proofreading skills. In this way, she can express her gratitude for the guiding she received and participate in dissemination of the idea of Nonviolent Communication in Poland. She is able to connect people who try to understand the other, to look beyond the surface of human actions, who also want to accompany children with an openness, curiosity, acceptance and tenderness. She hopes that her children will be able to enter adult life as people who have a beautiful interior, they are conscious of what is around them and at the same time they are connected with what is alive in them.</p>

              <p>I remember the moment in 2012 when I red Marshall Rosenberg's book Nonviolent Communication (NVC) and a lot of things fell into place for me. I learned the 'language' that brought and still brings me more awareness and connection with life. In 2016 I participated in Thom Bond's online course that has deepened my practice of the 'language', partly due to the many examples he has put in his course. I wanted to translate this course and share it with the Dutch-speaking world. The online course Mededogen Als Weg is the result. In addition to this online course, I have also give offline basic NVC courses for associations, companies and individuals for several years now. I also help people break patterns with hypnotherapy.</p>
